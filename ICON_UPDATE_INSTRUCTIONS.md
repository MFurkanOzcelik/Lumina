# 🎨 Icon Update Instructions

## ✅ What's Been Done

All the infrastructure for your custom icons is now ready! Here's what was completed:

### 1. Configuration Updated
- ✓ `package.json` configured to use `build/icon.png` for the app icon
- ✓ `package.json` configured to use `build/document-icon.png` for `.lum` files
- ✓ All platform configurations updated (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### 2. Tools & Documentation Created
- ✓ Automatic icon processing script (`build/process_icons.py`)
- ✓ Icon checker utility (`build/check_icons.bat`)
- ✓ Comprehensive setup guides in `build/` directory
- ✓ Aspect ratio protection (no distortion)

### 3. Pushed to GitHub
- ✓ All changes committed and pushed
- ✓ Ready for icon files to be added

## 🎯 What You Need to Do (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Save Your Two Images

You attached two images in your message. Please save them to the `build/` directory:

#### Image 1 - Application Icon (Blue/Orange Logo)
- **Save as**: `C:\not-app\build\app-icon-source.png`
- **This will become**: The main Lumina application icon (executable, taskbar, etc.)

#### Image 2 - Document Icon (Cyan/Pink Logo)
- **Save as**: `C:\not-app\build\doc-icon-source.png`
- **This will become**: The icon for all `.lum` note files

### Step 2: Process the Icons

Open PowerShell in `C:\not-app` and run ONE of these options:

#### Option A: Automatic (Recommended)
```powershell
# If you have Python with Pillow installed
python build/process_icons.py
```

This will automatically:
- Make both images perfectly square (adding transparent padding if needed)
- Resize to optimal dimensions (1024x1024 for app, 512x512 for docs)
- Save as `build/icon.png` and `build/document-icon.png`

#### Option B: Manual
If you don't have Python:
1. Make sure both images are square (same width and height)
2. Resize to at least 512x512 pixels
3. Save as PNG with transparency
4. Rename:
   - `app-icon-source.png` → `icon.png`
   - `doc-icon-source.png` → `document-icon.png`

#### Option C: Online Tools
Use these free online tools:
1. **Make Square**: https://www.iloveimg.com/crop-image (select 1:1 ratio)
2. **Resize**: https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image (to 512x512 or 1024x1024)
3. **Convert**: https://www.iloveimg.com/convert-to-png

### Step 3: Build the Application

```powershell
npm run electron:build:win
```

That's it! Your new icons will be embedded in:
- `release/Lumina Setup 1.2.0.exe` (installer)
- `release/Lumina 1.2.0.exe` (portable)

## 🔍 Verify Your Setup

Before building, run the checker script:

```powershell
.\build\check_icons.bat
```

This will tell you if both icon files are ready.

## ⚠️ Important: Aspect Ratio

**Your icons MUST be square (1:1 ratio) to prevent distortion!**

If your original images aren't square:
- ✅ **DO**: Add transparent padding to make them square
- ❌ **DON'T**: Stretch or squish the image

The Python script handles this automatically.

## 📊 Expected Results

After building, you'll have:
- **Application Icon**: Your blue/orange logo on the .exe file and in the taskbar
- **Document Icon**: Your cyan/pink logo on all .lum files in File Explorer

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't have Python"
No problem! Use Option B (manual) or Option C (online tools) above.

### "Icons look squished/distorted"
Your source images weren't square. Use the Python script or online tools to add padding.

### "Icons don't update after building"
1. Delete the old executables
2. Clear Windows icon cache: `ie4uinit.exe -show`
3. Rebuild the application

```

## 🚀 Quick Summary

1. Save your two attached images in `build/` as `app-icon-source.png` and `doc-icon-source.png`
2. Run `python build/process_icons.py` (or process manually)
3. Run `npm run electron:build:win`
4. Done! Your new icons are embedded.

## 📝 Notes

- No need to update version number (visual change only)
- Icons will work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- File associations will be registered during installation
- High-DPI displays are supported
