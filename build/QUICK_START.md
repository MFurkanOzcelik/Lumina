# Quick Start - Icon Setup

## 🎯 You're Almost Done!

The icon infrastructure is ready. You just need to save your two attached images.

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✓ `package.json` updated to use new icon paths
- ✓ Icon processing script created
- ✓ Comprehensive documentation added
- ✓ Build configuration ready

## 📋 What You Need to Do (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Save Your Images

You attached two images in your message. Please save them:

1. **First Image (App Logo - Blue/Orange)**: 
   - Right-click the image in the chat
   - Save as: `C:\not-app\build\app-icon-source.png`

2. **Second Image (Document Logo - Cyan/Pink)**:
   - Right-click the image in the chat  
   - Save as: `C:\not-app\build\doc-icon-source.png`

### Step 2: Process Icons

Open PowerShell in the project directory and run:

```powershell
# Option A: If you have Python + Pillow
python build/process_icons.py

# Option B: Manual (if no Python)
# Just rename your saved images:
# app-icon-source.png → icon.png
# doc-icon-source.png → document-icon.png
# (Make sure they're square and at least 512x512px)
```

### Step 3: Build

```powershell
npm run electron:build:win
```

That's it! Your new icons will be embedded in the application.

## 🔍 Verify Icons Are Square

If your icons look distorted after building, they might not be square. To check:

1. Right-click the image → Properties → Details
2. Look at "Dimensions" - should be like "512 x 512" (equal width and height)
3. If not square, use the Python script or online tools to add padding

## 📊 Expected File Structure

```
build/
├── app-icon-source.png    ← You save this (Image 1)
├── doc-icon-source.png    ← You save this (Image 2)
├── icon.png               ← Generated by script
├── document-icon.png      ← Generated by script
├── process_icons.py       ← Processing script
└── SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md  ← Detailed guide
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"I don't have Python"**
- No problem! Just make sure your images are:
  - Square (same width and height)
  - At least 512x512 pixels
  - PNG format with transparency
- Then rename them to `icon.png` and `document-icon.png`

**"Icons look squished"**
- Your source images aren't square
- Use online tool: https://www.iloveimg.com/crop-image
- Select 1:1 aspect ratio
- Add padding (don't stretch)

**"Icons don't update after building"**
- Delete old executable
- Clear Windows icon cache: `ie4uinit.exe -show`
- Rebuild
